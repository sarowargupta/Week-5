Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.
Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine.
The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.
Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy.
It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.
Java’s history is as interesting as it is impactful.
The journey of this powerful programming language began in 1991 when James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems known as the “Green Team,” set out to create a new language initially called “Oak.”
Oak was later renamed Java, inspired by Java coffee, and was first publicly released in 1996 as Java 1.0. This initial version provided a no-cost runtime environment across popular platforms, making it accessible to a broad audience.
Arthur Van Hoff rewrote the Java 1.0 compiler to strictly comply with its specifications, ensuring its reliability and cross-platform capabilities.
